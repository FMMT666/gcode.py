========

A little G-code sorter to speed up the PCB milling process with [PCB-GCode][1] for [Eagle][2].

For a little more info, including a binary distribution, follow [this link][3]. 

Although it has it's issues, like the currently still missing M02 command at the end of the
file (read the readme), I milled hundreds of PCB with it.

Yep, it works quite fine, but please notice that this code is (yet) from 2007 and might not
be compatible with newer PCB-GCode (or Eagle) releases.

Has to be tested, that's while it's now (4/2014) here, on Github...

Originally tested with:

 - pcb-gcode, emc output
 - hp2xx
